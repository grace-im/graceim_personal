# Relationship between COVID-19 cases and vaccinations
This repository is a Python designed to analyze the trend of updating COVID-19 cases and vaccination numbers in Illinois and create a data visualization to study a potential non-linear relationship between two data. It uses total vaccination data released by the New York Times and updating new case data. My goal from this study is to find a relationship between updating COVID-19 cases and vaccinations because I hypothesize that as the number of vaccinations increases, the number of new COVID-19 cases will decrease over time. Therefore, each graph for new cases and vaccination will show the opposite line. 

# Notes
From the given data, there were some missing data shown as NA. For example, data from 1/16/21 to 1/18/21 were missing, so I filtered out all NA data in order to properly graph the data.
